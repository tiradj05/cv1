		<h3>About</h3>
		<p>I’ve been working/supporting and managing (ERP) Enterprise Resource Planning systems since 1999. I started with PeopleSoft as the foundation of working with relational databases. I’ve been very fortunate to work with Developers early on…this exposure has help me to understand the importance of building relationships, understanding technical aspects and identifying functional requirements. Overall, helps me bridge the gap between “IT” (Technology) and the Managers (Business). I’ve managed multiple platforms (PSoft, Oracle, Success Factors, Ceridian, etc.) and oversee the data from Hire to Retire/Termination, and account for any changes within the employee’s history. I maintain the foundation tables, administer security, and generate any system (adhoc) reports as needed. I’ve worked in a variety of industries and understand the complexities of a company hierarchy, especially when the company is a global entity with a headcount over 50k. I believe all employees are clients, and should be treated with outstanding customer service.
